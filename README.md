# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-Banking-using-Transactional-Data

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in banking transactions. The dataset contains banking transactional data for 3 quarters, including customer IDs, transaction dates, transaction amounts, and other relevant features. The goal of this project is to analyze the data and build a machine learning model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn in the future.

### Data

The dataset used for this project contains banking transactional data for the past 3 quarters. The data is stored in a CSV file and includes the following columns:

customer_id: unique identifier for each customer
transaction_date: date of the transaction
transaction_amount: amount of the transaction
other_features: other relevant features for each transaction, such as type of transaction, location, etc.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Before building a predictive model, we first explore the data to gain insights and identify any trends or patterns. This involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, visualizing the data using charts and graphs, and performing statistical analysis.

### Machine Learning Models

We then build several machine learning models to predict customer churn based on the transactional data. This involves splitting the data into training and test sets, selecting appropriate features, and training and evaluating the models. We also use techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the models.

### Results

We evaluate the performance of the machine learning models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also generate visualizations to help interpret the results and gain insights into the predictions.

### Conclusion

Based on the results of our analysis, we provide recommendations for the bank to reduce customer churn and improve customer retention. We also discuss limitations and future directions for this project.

### Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
